# BFS-on-FPGA
Using FPGAs to accelerate BFS algorithm
## Introduction

In our final project, there is a part of the algorithm whose principle is similar to BFS, so I plan to accelerate a simple BFS algorithm with FPGA. If there is still room, use the accelerated BFS algorithm as a template to make modifications to the corresponding part of our project for the purpose of accelerating the project with FPGA.
